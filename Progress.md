**Branch:** restAPI-service

**Layer:** Service Implementation

---

#### Work Completed

* Refactored and standardized the `EventService` interface (organized by commands and queries).
* Implemented and cleaned the `EventServiceImpl` class with structured business logic.
* Added SLF4J logging for all service operations (create, update, publish, unpublish, cancel, delete, and queries).
* Created `logback-spring.xml` for colored console logs and rolling file logs.
* Implemented the `EventStatus` enum with `DRAFT`, `PUBLISHED`, and `CANCELLED` values and readable display names.
* Updated `Event` entity to default to `DRAFT` without null checks in service logic.
* Refactored query methods for consistent naming, transaction handling, and logging.
* Applied `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` to all read-only methods.

#### TODO

* Refactor the Mapper layer to align DTO-to-Entity conversions and include `statusDisplayName` mapping.
* Implement repository methods: `findBySlug`, `findByTypeIgnoreCase`, `findByStartAtBetween`, and `findByLocationContainingIgnoreCase`.
* Add unit and integration tests for the service layer.
* Verify logging configuration across environments.
* Begin Controller layer implementation once Mapper and Repository are complete.
