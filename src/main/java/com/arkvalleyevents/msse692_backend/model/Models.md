The Artist model uses a @ManyToMany relationship with Event, meaning an artist can perform at many events and an event can feature many artists. For a Venue model, the relationship is typically @OneToMany with Event, since a venue hosts many events, but each event usually occurs at one venue. So, in the Venue model, you would use:

We have three models: Artist, Event, and Venue.

- **Artist ↔ Event**: Uses a `@ManyToMany` relationship. An artist can perform at many events, and an event can feature many artists.
- **Venue ↔ Event**: Uses a `@OneToMany` relationship from Venue to Event. A venue hosts many events, but each event usually occurs at one venue (`@ManyToOne` from Event to Venue).

**Difference**:
- `@ManyToMany` allows both sides to have multiple references to each other.
- `@OneToMany`/`@ManyToOne` means one side (Venue) has many of the other (Event), but each Event has only one Venue.

Further considerations for a CMS
To turn these core entities into a full CMS, you would build on this foundation with additional Spring components:

    Repositories: Create Spring Data JPA repositories (e.g., ConcertEventRepository extends JpaRepository<ConcertEvent, Long>) to automatically provide methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
    Services: A service layer (e.g., ConcertEventService) would encapsulate business logic, like validating event data or managing relationships.
    Controllers: Implement Spring MVC REST controllers to handle HTTP requests for managing the CMS content. An admin-facing API could expose endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting events, venues, and artists.
    Security: Use Spring Security to secure CMS endpoints, ensuring only authenticated and authorized administrators can perform administrative tasks.
    UI/Frontend: A templating engine like Thymeleaf, integrated with Spring MVC, can render the web pages for both the public-facing and admin interfaces. For a modern approach, the controllers could expose REST APIs, and a separate JavaScript-based frontend could consume them.
